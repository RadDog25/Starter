# Starter

A basic webpack setup that includes:

* Dev Server with HTML, CSS, and JS hot reloading
* ES6 and SCSS compilation
* Production build process - bundling, minification, prefixing, and cache busting
* No frameworks

Use these commands to get going:

`npm install`

For hot reloading dev server
`npm run dev`

Production build
`npm run build`
